# Hi, I'm Piyush 🏾🖐 🏾🧑‍💻

<p>I am frontend developer working basically with JavaScript , HTML and CSS. I have working experience with AngualrJS framework.
Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time with family. I like do workout but I am not fitness freak. During the warmer months here in Copenhagen, I enjoy swimming.
When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
